Block Postion
===============================================

WordPress plugin - Block Position

## Description
This plugin allows you to combine multiple `wp_queries` into to one loop

The idea behind this plugin is to use WordPress a bit more single page style.

I found two plugins which gives me the start-up.
The first is the wordpress.org SVN hosted [Block Areas](https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-areas/) which gives me satisfaction for the first wireframe time to get responses.
Second plugin I found because of an old aim, the manipulation in general. [Combined Query](https://github.com/birgire/wp-combine-queries) show me good filter hooks and gives me more focus, more questions about manipulating the WordPress loop and to improve my UX. 

### Features
